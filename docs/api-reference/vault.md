# Vault

import { GitHubDiscussion } from "../../GitHubDiscussion.js";

Vault is the library used by Canvas Panel to load, normalise and track IIIF
resources. If using Canvas Panel solely as a tag, controlling its behaviour by
setting attributes, you don't need to interact with Vault directly. But if you
are bringing IIIF to Canvas Panel via script, you use Vault to manage IIIF
resources.

Any IIIF resource loaded into Vault is then available _through_ Vault as
_normalised_, 100% compliant IIIF Presentation API 3.0, even if it started out
as IIIF Presentation 2.0, or 2.1. This process of normalisation gives you a
consistent programming interface, without having to worry about the various
forms that the JSON-LD can take before version 3 of the Presentation API. It
also allows you to develop event-driven applications, because you can associate
event listeners directly with the IIIF resources managed and tracked in Vault.
You can also _subscribe_ to changes in the data in Vault, reacting to changes in
the resources managed by Vault.

This documentation site is full of examples showing Vault usage alongside Canvas
Panel. But it helps to begin by showing how Vault is used for general IIIF
purposes, before introducing its use with Canvas Panel.

## Installation

If you have Canvas Panel available on your page, you already have Vault, too.
But you can use it on its own, without Canvas Panel. See the
[installation instructions](../../docs/installation) for the full details. In
the following example, Vault is loaded from a CDN, avoiding any need to build or
run a server.

The next few examples use this HTML page to help make the demonstration visible.

## Working with IIIF

The first thing to do is load some IIIF. At the start of this walkthrough we
will use [this manifest](https://digirati-co-uk.github.io/journal.json):

```js
let manifestUri = "https://digirati-co-uk.github.io/journal.json";
```

Vault's `loadManifest()` function returns a Promise:

```js
vault.loadManifest(manifestUri).then(async (manifest) => {
    // work with the manifest
}
```

So we can use it in our demo page like this, slotting into
`async function demo(){..}` above.

```js
const manifest = await vault.loadManifest(manifestUri);
show(manifest, "Vault loads a manifest from a URI");
```

At first glance, this appears to have just printed out the manifest. But looking
closer, the JSON isn't the same.

- All the properties in the Presentation 3.0 API have been filled out, with
  default `null` or `[]` values, _even if the manifest didn't provide them_.
  Normalisation to IIIF Presentation 3.0 means that, even when we load
  Presentation 2.x resources, we don't have to worry about whether they are
  objects or arrays. Vault's further normalisation means the we don't have to
  test array properties for null, they will always be there, but may have no
  members. Anything that could be an array, will be an array, even if it's
  empty.
- Child resources in the graph, such as the canvases in `manifest.items`, only
  have `id` and `type` properties: they are _references_; when we need the full
  object we can obtain it from Vault using the reference, or the `id` on its
  own.

```json
"items": [
    {
      "id": "https://digirati-co-uk.github.io/journal/canvases/0",
      "type": "Canvas"
    },
    {
      "id": "https://digirati-co-uk.github.io/journal/canvases/1",
      "type": "Canvas"
    },
    //...
```

Vault has flattened and normalised the manifest; we can obtain the full (but
still _normalised_) canvas from a _reference_ like this:

```js
const canvas0 = vault.get(manifest.items[0]);
show(canvas0, "The canvas, using get(reference)");
```

Or, as a shortcut, just from the `id` like this:

```js
let canvas0Id = manifest.items[0].id;
show(canvas0Id, "The canvas ID, a string URL");
const canvas0 = vault.get(canvas0Id);
show(canvas0, "The canvas, using get(id)");
```

Now we can see the canvas JSON, and also see that its child properties (like
`thumbnail`) are also _references_.

We can also construct a reference manually:

```js
const myRef = {
  id: "https://digirati-co-uk.github.io/journal/canvases/0",
  type: "Canvas",
};
const canvas0a = vault.get(myRef);
show(canvas0a, "Constructing a reference manually");
console.log(canvas0 === canvas0a); // true ... they are the same object from the vault.
```

One reason for doing this is type-checking:

```js
const myBadRef = {
  id: "https://digirati-co-uk.github.io/journal/canvases/0",
  type: "Manifest",
};
const canvas0b = vault.get(myBadRef);
show(canvas0b, "There is no Manifest with that id in Vault!");
```

For resources like canvases, you will often want to do something with _all_ of
them. If you pass an array of references to `get`, you get an array of objects
back:

```js
const allCanvases = vault.get(manifest.items);
show(
  allCanvases[0],
  "The first of allCanvases - all obtained in one operation"
);
```

This `get` function gives us access to any resource in the Manifest:

```js
const provider = vault.get(manifest.provider[0]);
show(provider, "Provider - an Agent");
const logo = provider.logo[0]; // A logo for the manifest publisher
const img = document.createElement("img");
img.src = logo.id;
append(img);
```

## Additional helpers

The `vault-helpers` library brings some additional utilities. Add another
`script` tag immediately after the existing Vault one, and create a thumbnail
_helper_:

```html
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@iiif/helpers@latest/dist/index.umd.js"></script>
    <script>

    let manifestUri = "https://digirati-co-uk.github.io/journal.json";
    const vault = new IIIFHelpers.Vault();
    const thumbHelper = IIIFHelpers.createThumbnailHelper(vault);  // NEW - make a thumbnail helper
```

Now we can use this to help build user interface:

```js
// back in our demo function
for (const canvas of manifest.items) {
  const thumb = await thumbHelper.getBestThumbnailAtSize(canvas, {
    maxWidth: 200,
    maxHeight: 200,
  });
  show(thumb, "This is what the thumbnail helper returns"); // (we'll only see the last one)
  const img = document.createElement("img");
  img.src = thumb.best.id; // .best is an Image resource
  append(img);
}
```

The `getBestThumbnailAtSize` is a helper function that will attempt to find the
best thumbnail for a resource. In this example, we want to constrain our
thumbnails to 200 by 200. The helper will pick the most efficient thumbnail to
use. See the
[Vault Documentation](https://github.com/atlas-viewer/iiif-image-api/blob/main/src/types.ts#L39-L54)
for more details. (TODO - link to thumbnail documentation specifically).

### Other helpers

The vault-helpers library includes other helpers, including some used in other
parts of this documentation (for example, see `getValue` below).

A full list can be found at
[https://github.com/IIIF-Commons/vault-helpers](https://github.com/IIIF-Commons/vault-helpers).

## Following links to further resources

For this section we'll introduce a new manifest, that contains links to external
annotation pages from each canvas. In this case, the text transcription.

```js
const manifestWithAnnotations = await vault.loadManifest(
  "https://digirati-co-uk.github.io/wunder.json"
);
const canvas10 = vault.get(manifestWithAnnotations.items[10]);
show(canvas10);
```

:::info

`vault.load(..)` or `vault.loadManifest(..)`?

Explain how these differ, when you can use the string id and when you can use
the { id, type } reference form.

:::

In vault's view of this canvas, `items[0]` is a reference to an object already
loaded, because it was included in the manifest JSON. But `annotations` is not
loaded into Vault yet, because it points to an external resource. It's not a
reference to something we can get in full from the Vault at the moment, because
vault does not have it loaded.

```json
  "items": [
    {
      "id": "https://iiif.wellcomecollection.org/presentation/b18106158/canvases/B18106158_0011.jp2/painting",
      "type": "AnnotationPage"
    }
  ],
  "annotations": [
    {
      "id": "https://iiif.wellcomecollection.org/annotations/v3/b18106158/B18106158_0011.jp2/line",
      "type": "AnnotationPage",
      "label": {
        "en": [
          "Text of page 11"
        ]
      }
    }
  ],
```

:::info

> TODO - How can we tell this? If it didn't have a label it would look the same
> as a ref.

> THIS SECTION NEEDS WORK PENDING SOME VAULT CHANGES:

A user interface might display the labels of any annotation lists here, and
offer the user the ability to load them.

> TODO - Vault needs to include labels on references to optimise this kind of
> linking.

:::

At this point we'll introduce an extra helper function for the demo. While it's
easy to get the `label` property, it's not always easy to use it because it is a
Language Map, rather than a string. The `getValue` helper gives us a string that
we can display to the user:

```js
// we can safely do things like this without checking to see if canvas10.annotations is null,
// because Vault normalises array properties to empty arrays.

let loadedAnnoPage; // this will be the last loaded but here we know there's only one
for (const annoPage of canvas10.annotations) {
  // the .annotations property is an array of 0..n AnnotationPage resources.
  console.log(IIIFHelpers.getValue(annoPage.label));
  // how do we know these are not inline?
  let embedded = annoPage.items && !vault.requestStatus(annoPage);
  if (!embedded) {
    console.log("This needs to be loaded");
    // As a resource external to the manifest, we load annotations specifically, from their id:
    loadedAnnoPage = await vault.load(annoPage.id);
    show(loadedAnnoPage, "The dereferenced AnnotationPage");
  }
}
```

These particular annotations are lines of text, so we are more likely to want
access to them all directly:

```js
const lines = vault.get(loadedAnnoPage.items);
let pageText = [];
for (const line of lines) {
  const lineBody = vault.get(line.body[0]);
  pageText.push(lineBody.value);
}
show(pageText, "The full text of the page");
```

When using Canvas Panel, you will more likely make use of Canvas Panel's API to
[work with annotations](../../docs/examples/annotations) on the Canvas. And for
annotation scenarios that involve multiple text fragments, such as the lines of
text here or captions on a video, Canvas Panel has a companion component called
[text-lines](../../docs/future/handling-text), that will bind to these
annotations and render them.

:::info

> What if my json has a conflicting id?

Vault merges the object graph, so if you had a canvas with:

```json
{ "id": "http://example.org/annotation-page-1", "type": "AnnotationPage" }
```

And then loaded that data into Vault, and then constructed your own additional
annotations in-memory (e.g., in an app), and then called this:

```js
vault.load("http://example.org/annotation-page-1", myInMemoryAnnotations);
```

...Vault would _merge_ the annotations in `myInMemoryAnnotations` into the
existing `AnnotationPage` object with that `id`.

:::

## More Vault features - Metadata

At this stage the `demo()` function is getting a little cluttered. Keeping the
rest of the page intact, remove the contents of the demo function and start
again with this:

```js
async function demo() {
  // ##################################################################
  // the script snippets in the following examples should be added here
  // ##################################################################

  let manifestUri = "https://digirati-co-uk.github.io/finsbury.json";
  const manifest = await vault.loadManifest(manifestUri);
}
```

Beyond storing the IIIF Model, Vault's additional functionality is built on the
ability to store arbitrary application metadata alongside the IIIF entities.
Usually this happens under the hood, behind other API calls, but you can also
build on this feature yourself:

```js
// store some arbitrary information in the vault for this manifest
vault.setMetaValue([manifest.id, "MyCustomStorage", "myKey"], "myValue");
// "MyCustomStorage" provides a scope, into which you can put keys and values.

// now retrieve this data from the Vault:
let resourceMeta = vault.getResourceMeta(manifest.id);
show(resourceMeta, "stored custom metadata");
```

Having stored this data, we can now _subscribe_ to changes in it, via Vault's
`subscribe` function - `function subscribe(selector, subscription)`, where
`selector` is a function in which you return the particular slice of Vault you
want to subscribe to, and `subscription` is a function that Vault will call when
that slice changes.

Vault calls your suscription callback with two arguments: `(selection, vault)`,
where `selection` is the part of the state you subscribed to, and `vault` is a
ref to Vault itself, so you can handle this callback without an existing
reference to vault (e.g., in another library or external code). Often you won't
need this second `vault` argument, as in the immediate example below:

```js
const unsubscribe1 = await vault.subscribe(
  (state) => state.iiif.meta[manifest.id], // define the selection
  (selection) => show(selection, "selection callback") // handle a change to that selection
);
```

Vault's `subscribe` returns a function that you can call to unsubscribe, when
needed.

If we start modifying vault, then vault will start calling our subscriptions:

```js
// We get an initial callback when first subscribing.
// Now if we update, we get another:
await vault.setMetaValue([manifest.id, "MyCustomStorage", "myKey"], "myValue2");

// and we can see new metadata:
await vault.setMetaValue(
  [manifest.id, "MyCustomStorage2", "myKey2"],
  "myValue2"
);
```

Had we been more specific in our selection, we could have focussed on just one
"scope". To see this, first clear our existing subscription:

```js
unsubscribe1();
```

Now set up a _scoped_ subscription:

```js
await vault.subscribe(
  (state) => state.iiif.meta[manifest.id]["MyCustomStorage"], // Now listen to just this scope
  (selection) => show(selection, "specific selection callback") // handle a change to that selection
);

// we see this:
await vault.setMetaValue([manifest.id, "MyCustomStorage", "myKey"], "myValue3");
// but now, we don't see this:
await vault.setMetaValue(
  [manifest.id, "MyCustomStorage2", "myKey2"],
  "myValue4"
);
```

### Subscribing to IIIF changes

The above shows subscriptions on arbitrary data, but we're more likely to be
interested in changes to known IIIF entities in vault. Consider this loading of
an annotation page:

```js
const canvas10 = vault.get(manifest.items[10]);
const annotationPageId = canvas10.annotations[0].id;

// we can subscribe to changes on this Annotation Page:
await vault.subscribe(
  (state) => {
    // When this slice of the store changes...
    const annotationPage = state.iiif.entities.AnnotationPage[annotationPageId];
    console.log(
      "Vault is obtaining state (anno page has " +
        annotationPage.items.length +
        " items)."
    );
    return annotationPage;
  },
  (annotationPage) => {
    console.log(
      "(callback on change) " + annotationPage.items.length + " items"
    );
    show(
      [
        IIIFHelpers.getValue(annotationPage.label),
        annotationPage.items.length + " items",
      ],
      "Annotation Page"
    );
  }
);
```

Vault only has the _reference_ to the annotation page at the moment. This is why
it has 0 items. So let's load it (in your application the user might be choosing
to load in some external annotations; their interaction action triggers a
modification of vault data, and the UI can respond). Changes to vault's state
from loading resources will be reflected in subscriptions, but if you directly
modify vault resources (e.g., property value), this won't trigger a
notification. It's OK to modify vault data this way, but to hook into the
subscription, it needs to be mutated via `modifyEntityField` as below:

```js
console.log("Now going to load the anno page");
const annoPage = await vault.load(annotationPageId); // This will trigger it straight away, before the data is loaded

console.log("Now going to load the anno page");
const annoPage = await vault.load(annotationPageId); // This will trigger it straight away, before the data is loaded
// (The event fires and shows that there are now 38 items.)

// now make some changes
annoPage.label = [{ en: ["I have changed the label"] }];
// Making a direct change like this is allowed, and updates the data in Vault, but won't notify subscribers.
// (no event fires, no additional subscriber notification appears)

// This is how you notify subscribers:
vault.modifyEntityField(annoPage, "label", {
  en: ["I have changed the label again"],
});
// Now we see the change appear.
```

Metadata and subscriptions are the foundation of some of canvas Panel's built in
tools. They use Vault's storage facilities to build application functionality.
You can do the same. Event Handlers are a good example.

### Event Handlers in Vault

The set of metadata that Vault can track for any resource includes an _event
manager_:

```js
show(
  vault.getResourceMeta(manifest.id).eventManager,
  "Event manager for " + manifest.id
);
// undefined

// Introducing another helper
const events = IIIFHelpers.createEventsHelper(vault);

// There is no event manager for this entity, yet. But if we start adding event listeners, one wil be created:
events.addEventListener(manifest, "onClick", (e) => {
  console.log("clicked", this);
});

// Now we have one -
show(
  vault.getResourceMeta(manifest.id).eventManager,
  "Event manager for " + manifest.id
);
```

Vault's eventsHelper is very simply a means of storing event handlers for
identified resources - that's all it is, it's not raising these events itself.
In an application you might have multiple DOM elements that correspond to IIIF
resources (e.g., thumbnail images corresponding to canvases). This mechanism
gives you the option of storing event handlers alongside other metadata. In
practice this low-level API is unlikely to be convenient for direct use, but it
is the basis of Canvas Panel's higher level API functions.

If we add a button to our "app", we can give it an event listener that Vault is
storing for us.

```js
const manifestButton = document.createElement("button");
manifestButton.innerText = "Click the manifest";
append(manifestButton);

await vault.subscribe(
  (state) => state.iiif.meta[manifest.id],
  (selection) => {
    if (selection && selection.eventManager) {
      // selection.eventManager.onClick is an array of event handlers that you can attach to your DOM elements.
      manifestButton.addEventListener(
        "click",
        selection.eventManager.onClick[0].callback
      );
    }
  }
);
```

To conclude this discussion of events, a slightly more realistic example -
storing canvases in Vault, and managing click handlers for thumbnails for those
canvases.

Here we use Vault's metadata subscription to state for a viewer application. If
the loaded manifest changes, we want to react to this:

```js
vault.setMetaValue(
  ["ViewerState", "LoadedResources", "CurrentManifest"],
  manifest.id
);
await vault.subscribe(
  (state) => state.iiif.meta["ViewerState"],
  (selection) => {
    if (selection && selection.LoadedResources) {
      LoadManifest(selection.LoadedResources.CurrentManifest);
    }
  }
);
```

For clarity, add this `LoadManifest` function to the script after the demo()
function. Our click handler for the thumbnails just pulls the corresponding
canvas out of Vault and displays the JSON. This is where you could _give the
Canvas to Canvas Panel!_

```js
async function LoadManifest(manifestId) {
  const manifest = await vault.loadManifest(manifestId);
  const events = IIIFHelpers.createEventsHelper(vault);
  const thumbHelper = IIIFHelpers.createThumbnailHelper(vault);

  for (const canvas of manifest.items) {
    // give these handlers a scope, we may wish to have other click handlers for the same canvases elsewhere
    events.addEventListener(canvas, "onClick", () => show(vault.get(canvas)), [
      "Thumbs",
    ]);
  }

  await vault.subscribe(
    (state) => state.iiif.entities.Manifest[manifestId], // (can't subscribe to [manifest.id].items)
    (selection, vault) => {
      // selection is the manifest. When the manifest changes...
      document.getElementById("app").innerHTML = "";
      for (const canvas of selection.items) {
        // ...create an image element for each canvas
        const thumb = document.createElement("img");

        // You can interact with an eventManager for a resource:
        // const canvasManager = vault.getResourceMeta(canvas.id).eventManager;
        // thumb.addEventListener("click", canvasManager.onClick[0].callback);

        // Or use this more convenient API - note we have retrieved the event listeners for our Thumbs scope.
        const props = events.getListenersAsProps(canvas, "Thumbs");
        thumb.addEventListener("click", props.onClick);

        // Now set the src of the image to a thumbnail using vault-helpers:
        thumbHelper
          .getBestThumbnailAtSize(canvas, { maxWidth: 100 })
          .then((cvThumb) => (thumb.src = cvThumb.best.id));
        append(thumb);
      }
    }
  );
}
```

It may be difficult to see the changes in the Canvas JSON as you click different
thumbnails, as the structure is the same for all. Look at the canvas labels to
see that the page number is different.
