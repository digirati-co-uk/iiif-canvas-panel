# Installation

Canvas panel is made up of several
[Web Components](https://www.webcomponents.org/). In order to use the components
you need to have a `<script/>` tag loaded on your webpage. You can also include
them in your existing bundler of choice.

The provided Web Components are as follows:

- `<canvas-panel />` - this is the primary web component, used for rendering any
  single IIIF canvas.
- `<image-service />` - this is a web component that can be used without a IIIF
  manifest and only an Image service.
- `<sequence-panel />` - This is a web component that can show a sequence of
  Canvases either from a Manifest or a Range.

Canvas panel also uses a few libraries to provide IIIF functionality.

- [Vault](https://github.com/IIIF-Commons/vault) is the library used by Canvas
  Panel to load, normalise and track IIIF resources.
- [Vault-helpers](https://github.com/IIIF-Commons/vault-helpers/) contains
  additional utilities for working with IIIF resources, such as `getLabel` and
  `getThumbnail`.
- [Canvas Panel](https://github.com/digirati-co-uk/iiif-canvas-panel) is the web
  component. Its distribution includes vault and the various web components.
- [IIIF Image API](https://github.com/atlas-viewer/iiif-image-api) is a utility
  library for working with IIIF Image resources

<Tabs>

<Tab label="Script tag" value="script-tag" default>
    
The web components (canvas-panel and image-service) are bundled in one script:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@digirati/canvas-panel-web-components@latest"></script>

<canvas-panel
  manifest-id="https://digirati-co-uk.github.io/wunder.json"
  canvas-id="https://digirati-co-uk.github.io/wunder/canvases/0"
>
</canvas-panel>
```

This also gives you access to [Vault](./api-reference/vault), for doing things
programmatically:

```html {7}
<canvas-panel id="cp"></canvas-panel>

<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@digirati/canvas-panel-web-components@latest"></script>
<script>
  const cp = document.getElementById("cp");
  const manifestUrl = "https://digirati-co-uk.github.io/wunder.json";
  cp.vault
    .load(manifestUrl)
    .then((manifest) => console.log(manifest.items.length));
</script>
```

You can use Vault independently of the Canvas Panel web component:

```html {4-5}
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@iiif/helpers@latest/dist/index.umd.js"></script>
<script>
  const manifestUrl = "https://digirati-co-uk.github.io/wunder.json";
  const vault = new IIIFHelpers.Vault();
  vault
    .load(manifestUrl)
    .then((manifest) => console.log(manifest.items.length));
</script>
```

([Read more about Vault](./api-reference/vault))
