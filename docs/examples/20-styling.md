A discussion of styling quirks

You can also style image services using their image service ID (no canvas ID)
 -->

There are 3 types of object you can style:

- Canvases
- Annotation pages
- Annotations

As there is no representation of an Annotation Page in the viewer, this style is
used as a cascade for styling annotations. Any styles applied to annotation
pages will be applied to annotations inside. This allows you to style full sets
of annotations at once.

Canvases only support opacity. Annotations support box styles, but may also have
custom CSS applied to them.

Styles can be applied either by using a **vault helper** or by using a property
from the web component. If you use the Vault helper you can apply styles prior
to rendering your canvas panel. If you use the Vault Helper you should ensure
that you pass in a scope of `atlas` as the 3rd argument.

## Box styles

There are currently a subset of styles that can be applied to annotations that
will be rendered using the HTML canvas if that is available. This will improve
performance if you have large numbers of annotations being displayed - such as
OCR annotations.

```ts
cp.applyStyles(annotationPage, {
  backgroundColor: "rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5)",
  border: "3px solid blue",
  outline: "3px solid #000",
  opacity: 0.5,
});
```

Full list of properties:

```typescript
interface BoxStyles {
  backgroundColor: string; // colour or gradient function
  opacity: number;
  borderColor: string;
  borderWidth: string;
  borderStyle: string; // 'solid' only
  outlineColor: string;
  outlineWidth: string;
  outlineOffset: string;
  outlineStyle: string; // 'solid' only

  // Parsed.
  boxShadow: string;
  border: string; // 'solid' only
  outline: string; // 'solid' only
  background: string; // Alias for `backgroundColor:`
}
```

### States

You can set hover and active states, that support all the above properties. This
can be used to create some basic interactivity for your annotations. These
should be enough for most cases and avoid de-optimising and using CSS classes
directly.

```ts
cp.applyStyles(annotationPage, {
  backgroundColor: "rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5)",
  ":hover": {
    backgroundColor: "rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)",
  },
  ":active": {
    backgroundColor: "blue",
  },
});
```

### Vault helper

If you decide to use
[Vault helpers](https://github.com/IIIF-Commons/vault-helpers) you will need to
ensure you pass in the correct scope when you apply styles.

```ts
import { createStyleHelper } from "@iiif/helpers";
import { globalVault } from "@iiif/helpers/vault";

const helper = createStyleHelper(globalVault());

// For box styles.
helper.applyStyle(
  annotation,
  {
    background: "red",
  },
  "atlas"
);

// For setting a class name
helper.applyStyle(
  annotation,
  {
    className: "my-custom-style",
  },
  "html"
);
```

### Quirks

Some quirks of the box style.

- You can only use solid borders and outlines
- Box-sizing is fixed to content-box (so annotations may be shifted by borders)
- Some styles may not match exactly

## CSS Styles

If you would like to add more styles than these options you can set a custom
class name instead.

```ts
cp.setClassName(annotationPage, "my-custom-class");
```

Canvas panel exists in a web-component, so styles will not work out of the box.
You have 3 options for applying styles.

**1. Using `::part()`, which must be used instead of `.my-custom-class`**

```html
<style>
  canvas-panel::part(my-custom-class) {
    background: red;
  }
</style>
```

**2. Using `style-id`, where you can use normal CSS classses.**

```html
<style id="my-style">
  .my-custom-class {
    background: red;
  }
</style>
<canvas-panel style-id="my-style"></canvas-panel>
```

**3. Using an external stylesheet (where you can use normal CSS classes)**

```html
<canvas-panel stylesheet="https://example.org/styles.css"></canvas-panel>
```

## Styling with FlexBox

To demonstrate how canvas panel can flex to fill its container, it's best to
open this demo in the code sandbox and then open the preview in a new window.

<Sandbox project={flexbox} />

## Opacity

You can set the opacity of resources via their `id`. In this case, the `id` of
the image resource that is the body of the painting annotation:

<Sandbox project={opacity2} />

You can also set the opacity of a particular item within a Choice:

```html
<canvas-panel
  iiif-content="http://example.org/canvas-1.json"
  choice-id="http://example.org/choice-set-a/3, http://example.org/choice-set-b/7#opacity=0.5"
/>
Useful for static rendering -----^
```

<Sandbox project={opacity} />

Tile rendering is not as optimised when applying opacity. Canvas Panel does not
layer multiple tiles when zooming - just one layer of tiles, so no nice
blending, otherwise you'd see through to the fallback layers with the opacity.
